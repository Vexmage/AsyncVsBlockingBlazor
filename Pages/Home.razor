<h2>Welcome to the Async vs Blocking Demo</h2>

<p>
    This site is a simple interactive tool designed to demonstrate the differences
    between <strong>blocking (synchronous)</strong> and <strong>asynchronous</strong>
    execution in C# using Blazor WebAssembly.
</p>

<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blocking code</strong> (e.g., <code>Thread.Sleep</code>) pauses execution, making applications unresponsive.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous code</strong> (e.g., <code>Task.Delay</code>) allows apps to remain responsive while waiting for tasks to complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Parallel execution</strong> lets multiple tasks run simultaneously, improving efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What You Can Do Here:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Compare execution times between <strong>blocking</strong> and <strong>async</strong> methods.</li>
    <li>See how <strong>parallel async execution</strong> can improve performance.</li>
    <li>Make <strong>API calls</strong> and save the results to a local database.</li>
</ul>
